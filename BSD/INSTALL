Currently  three ways  are supported  for installing  the  reader into
ParaView:  install  as a  plugin,  install  by  patching the  ParaView
sources, and install by extending  ParaView at compile time. In either
case, please  do not  forget to set  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to  Release when
configuring  with CMake  in order  for compiler  optimization  to work
unless you have a specific intention for choosing other options.


Install as an out-of-source plugin
==================================

The plugin can be compiled and installed in a usual manner as an
out-of-source ParaView plugin. Refer to The ParaView Guide.


Install as an in-source plugin
==============================

The plugin can be compiled and installed in a usual manner as an
in-source ParaView plugin. Copy the source directory to
ParaView3/Plugins and add a paraview_build_optional_plugin() line to
ParaView3/Plugins/CMakeLists.txt like other plugins.


Install as a builtin reader by patching the ParaView sources
============================================================

Currently ParaView 3.6.2 is supported.

1. Copy vtkNewOpenFOAMReader.{cxx,h} to ParaView3/VTK/IO
2. Apply 3.6.2/CMakeLists_IO.txt.diff to ParaView3/VTK/IO/CMakeLists.txt
3. Copy vtkNewPOpenFOAMReader.{cxx,h} to ParaView3/VTK/Parallel
4. Apply 3.6.2/CMakeLists_Parallel.txt.diff to
   ParaView3/VTK/Parallel/CMakeLists.txt
5. Copy CMake/FindRegex.cmake to ParaView3/VTK/CMake
6. Replace the section enclosed by
     <!-- Beginning of FOAM Reader -->
   and
     <!-- End of foam Reader -->
   in ParaView3/Servers/ServerManager/Resources/readers.xml with
   the section enclosed by
     <!-- Beginning of Parallel OF Reader -->
   and
     <!-- End of Parallel OF Reader -->
   in the included POpenFOAMReaderSM.xml.


Install by extending ParaView at compile time
=============================================

Refer to the "Build Code As Part Of ParaView" section of
http://paraview.org/Wiki/Extending_ParaView_at_Compile_Time.
The module name is POpenFOAMReader.

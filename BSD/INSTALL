Currently  three ways  are supported  for installing  the  reader into
ParaView:  install  as a  plugin,  install  by  patching the  ParaView
sources, and install by extending  ParaView at compile time. In either
case, please  do not  forget to set  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to  Release when
configuring  with CMake  in order  for compiler  optimization  to work
unless you have a specific intention for choosing other options.

===================

The plugin can be compiled and installed in a usual manner as a

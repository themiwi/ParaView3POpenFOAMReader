OpenFOAM native reader for ParaView 3.3/3.4/3.5

Description
===========

This is a package of OpenFOAM native reader for ParaView 3.3/3.5-CVS
and its experimental parallelized implementation for decomposed
OpenFOAM cases of parallel simulations.

Manifest
========

  BSD/    serial reader covered by the ParaView license
  GPL/    parallel reader and additional reader UIs covered by GPL
  README  this file

Installation
============

For now the installation configuration of the readers is a bit
irregular: the installation of serial reader will be done by
overwriting the existing reader in the ParaView source tree, while the
parallelized reader and the additional reader UI will be built as plugins.

First install the serial reader as noted by BSD/ReleaseNotes, then
proceed to install the parallel reader following
GPL/ReleaseNotes.

[!!IMPORTANT!!] You must install both of the serial and parallel
reader even if you only need the serial reader.

Notes
=====

1. The reason why the readers are covered by different licenses comes
   from the fact I am using the opensource version of Qt, which
   enforces assignment of GPL for its adoption. In fact the only
   materials that must be coverd by GPL are the additional UI. The
   parallel reader may be covered by the BSD license if I divide the
   building process of the parallel reader and the UI but I did this
   way for simplicity of installation. I will be glad to hear a good
   solution.

ToDo
====

1. Simplification of installation steps.

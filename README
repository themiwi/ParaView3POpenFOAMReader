OpenFOAM native reader for ParaView 3.3/3.5-CVS

Description
===========

This is a package of OpenFOAM native reader for ParaView 3.3/3.5-CVS
and its experimental parallelized implementation for decomposed
OpenFOAM cases of parallel simulations.

Manifest
========

  BSD/    serial reader covered by the ParaView license
  GPL/    parallel reader and additional reader UIs covered by GPL
  README  this file

Installation
============

For now the installation configuration of the readers is a bit
irregular: the installation of serial reader will be done by
overwriting the existing reader in the ParaView source tree, while the
parallelized reader and the additional reader UIs will be built as plugins.

First install the serial reader as noted by BSD/ReleaseNotes, then
proceed to install the parallel reader following
GPL/ReleaseNotes. Note that in order to install the parallelized
reader, the serial reader must have been installed.

Notes
=====

1. The reason why the readers are covered by different licenses comes
   from the fact I am using the opensource version of Qt, which
   enforces assignment of GPL for its adoption. In fact the only
   materials that must be coverd by GPL are the additional UIs. The
   parallel reader may be covered by the BSD license but I did this
   way for clarity and simplicity. I will be glad to hear a good
   solution.

ToDo
====

* Simplification of installation steps.
